# SimpleNavalBattle
A little sea battle game with what I know about Java.

- It consists of a field with X by Y blocks; 
- The player can choose between play with another player or play with the computer;
- Any player can have xpto ships within 1/3 size limit of the board;
- The ships are inserted randomly;
- The game should show each board separately every shift;
- Each shift, the player will choose where It wants to "Shoot";
- The first player that destruct all the opponent's ships wins;
- The game should show the "Board";
- The simbols are:
  - "Void" - Nothing there;
  - "x" - Wrong shoot;
  - "d" - Destroyed a ship;
