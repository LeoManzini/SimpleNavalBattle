# SimpleNavalBattle
A little sea battle game with what I know about Java.

It consists of a field with X by Y blocks; 
The player can choose between play with another player or play with the
computer;
Any player can have xpto ships;
The ships are inserted randomly;
The game should show each board separately every shift;
Each shift, the player will choose where It wants to "Shoot";
The first player that destruct all the opponent's ships wins;
The game should show the "Board";
The simbols are:
"Void" - Nothing there;
"x" - Wrong shoot;
"d" - Destroyed a ship;
