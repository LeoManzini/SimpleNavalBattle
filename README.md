# SimpleNavalBattle
A little sea battle game with what I know about Java.

- It consists of a field with X by Y blocks; 
- The player can choose between play with another player or play with the computer;
- Any player can have xpto ships within 1/3 size limit of the board;
- The ships are inserted randomly;
- The game should show each board separately every shift;
- Each shift, the player will choose where It wants to "Shoot";
- The first player that destruct all the opponent's ships wins;
- The game should show the "Board".

- The simbols are:
  - " " - Nothing there;
  - "X" - Wrong shoot;
  - "D" - Destroyed a ship;
  - "S" - Ship.

Game already ready to play, but i'll refactor into object oriented
programming and make a better verification for duplicated shots.

- Game Version 1.0
- Executable file at the folder "Executable", to run the game, you have that install Java on your PC and download the NavalBattle.jar.
- To execute: at your terminal enter at the folder that you save the .jar file and type: 
	- java -jar NavalBattle.jar

- I hope you enjoy!
